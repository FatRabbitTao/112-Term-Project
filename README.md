# 112TermProject

#IMMUNITY
Description:
This project is a naive attempt to recreate an organic version of famous Real-Time-Strategy (RTS) games such as StarCraft. In this game, player controls units of cells to attack the virus and defend the base (as well as other buildings). In this process, the player is supposed to collect resources, build buildings and use various features of the cells to kill the viruses. The game will end when all the buildings of the player are destoyed or when player reached the target number of viruses killed and choose not to continue playing.
